## Overview

This is a simple Todo list app built with HTML, CSS and Javascript. The app has all basic functions that allows users add, delete and filter todos. Users can also drag and drop to rearrange the todos ðŸ˜‰

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos
- Toggle light and dark mode
- **Bonus**: Drag and drop to reorder items on the list

## My process

I started by coding the design with HTML and CSS, and hardcoded the todos at first, so that i can get all the styling right. Then i took out all hardcoded todos from the page and added the functionality with Javascript that lets users create the todos. The Javascript took more time to implement and I learned a lot during the process.

As soon as everything worked fine, I refactored my code a bit then noted functionalities that I may add in the future e.g storing the todos so that they are accessible and according to date. Add a "view previous todo list that has two options, go back one step or choose the exact date of the todo list you want to view.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Javascript
- SortableJs library

### Continued development

I'll continue to build more websites/apps using HTML CSS and Javascript to improve my skills then learn more about APIs and then React
